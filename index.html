Practiced among book groups, friends and colleagues at work, it provides an inexpensive way for people to exchange books, find out about new books and obtain a new book to read without having to pay.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
  As an avid Goodreads user, I had a hypothesis that they were overlooking an opportunity to serve both user and business needs through a book swapping service. They have a strong user base who engage in creating book lists, building personal bookshelves, and writing reviews, but through a book swapping feature, 
  they could further strengthen ties between users and offer an environmental friendly initiative which would extend a books usage. My hypothesis was that this would also solve the user need of how to discard unwanted books - this was rebutted during my research, but more on that later!<br/><br/><br/><br/>
  Target Users for this application are Book reading Enthusiasts. These Enthusiasts has to spend lot of money purchasing books, as scope for knowledge gaining though book reading is end-less. One way these enthusiasts can save money is by exchanging books with their neighbors. But this methodology has limitations. These limitations include but not limited to-

neighbors may not have a book that interests a Book Reader.<br/><br/><br/>
Neighbors might not be willing to swap their Books. Clearly, to overcome these limitations, we need a System, that bring all Book Readers (who are willing to swap their Books with each other) together. This application Book Swapper exactly addresses above mentioned limitations, which brings Book Reading enthusiasts together.
 As a result users are left with large number of reading options, without spending extra money. Further description in this user manual assists users in getting familiar with the application.<br/><br/><br/>
 Some of my favorite presents are books from friends who have carefully thought about what I enjoy and personalize the recommendation for me. Books are art, and art is subjective. This means it truly takes consideration to recommend a book to someone. I mean, there are so many things tangible and intangible that make someone like a book. Forget about the basics like plotting and characterization; it’s also important to consider the person’s interests as well as what they previously enjoyed reading. A great way to get some solid recommendations is to arrange a book swap. How does a book exchange work, though?
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Here really aren’t many rules for these, because it changes based on who you’re swapping a book with and the when and where said swap it occurring. But if you get the rules right with the right people, you just might walk away with a new favorite read.

If you are interested in scaling your book swapping and/or book exchanging, here are a few things to consider.
